Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM I went through your history and would like make suggestions as follows1 As per my understanding, inhalers are helpful in managing acute exacerbations of wheezing episodes - Salbutamol or Levo-cetirizine can be used 2 However if it is not working better with an oral steroid therapy then a corticosteroid injection may also help 3 If symptoms do worsen despite using salmeterole alone after the treatment sessions than inhaled steroids should never use 4 Also certain types such medications including antihistamines must always take care that they contain only some ingredients which could cause side effects 5 In addition i suggest patients who have already taken prednisone injections regularly over years when there has been no improvement by adding
